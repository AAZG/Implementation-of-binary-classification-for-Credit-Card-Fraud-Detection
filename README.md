# Implementation-of-binary-classification-for-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

## Motivation.
Learn and practice within the branch of data science.

## Problem it solves.
Need to carry out a classification to determine the legality or fraud in transactions made with credit cards of the bank's customers.

## Completed.
- Data cleaning and Data preprocessing
- EDA: Univariate and multivariate analysis
- robust techniques treat extreme outliers
- Scaling Data
- Models deployment Binary Classification.
- Classification with LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier and KNeighborsClassifier

## Characteristics.
* The project was done in a jupyter labs notebook.
* Within the project there are observations as the analysis progresses.
* You can interact with many of the charts since the Plotly library was used.


## Participants.
The project was carried out individually.
